    'The Assistant',
    "Whenever Jane (Julia Garner) has to write an apology email to her boss, the other assistants in the room reflexively come up behind her to suggest wording. It's not my place to question your decisions, they murmur over her shoulder as she types, I'm grateful for the continued opportunity. It's a ritual of abasement to which they've obviously become accustomed. Jane, on the other hand, is still learning the ropes at the New York film company at which The Assistant is set. She occupies the lowest rung on the ladder, which is why she has to arrive first, in the pre-dawn darkness, to open up the office. It's also why she puts on gloves and cleans up whatever new stains have been deposited on the couch in the chairman's office. The expression on her face when she does this is the same as the one that's there when she washes the dishes left in the kitchen by co-workers who don't even seem to see her. It's the tight, pallid look of someone trying to get through things without thinking too hard about what she's doing.",
